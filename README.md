# course_registration_with_hierarchy
Term project I have done with Python and a database mainly about managing permissions, different roles accessing different functionalities within the system.

The CMD can be ran by running the file main.py and launching the CMD interface. It can be seen that different roles have access to different things, and the courses that students have registered for for example can only be verified by their assigned advisors and only their assigned advisors.
